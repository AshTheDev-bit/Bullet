# Bullet
Project for practicing with creating particle effects, collision, shaders, and tighter player movement. Being built in c++ with use of SFML

This is personal project where I'm going to look into creating a "design a bullet hell" level maker idea. 
It's a project where I can work on some things im interested in such as particle systems and shaders in a 2D space. While also polishing up my weak points (which is many)

Shaders, and fast collision calculations will be a focus along with  brushing up on my physics and in the very late stages UI design skills as I wish to use this
as a demo of sorts.

In a perfect world ill be able to have a few placeable projectile objects, a player character, and a simple level maker by the end of August.
But work and the possibility of repeat exams will come first. So lets see how we go
